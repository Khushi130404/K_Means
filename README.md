# K_Means

This repository, K_Means, contains implementations and visualizations of the K-Means clustering algorithm in both 2D and 3D, along with a self-created K-Means model. The project includes interactive Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and Python scripts (.py files) for ease of use and reproducibility.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations
- The repository includes several visualizations to better understand the clustering process:
- 2D Clustering Graphs: Shows the separation of data points into distinct clusters.
- 3D Clustering Graphs: Provides an interactive 3D view of clustered data points.
- Iteration-wise Graphs: Displays how clusters evolve with each iteration of the K-Means algorithm.
