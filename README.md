# K_Means

This repository, K_Means, contains implementations and visualizations of the K-Means clustering algorithm in both 2D and 3D, along with a self-created K-Means model. The project includes interactive Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and Python scripts (.py files) for ease of use and reproducibility.
